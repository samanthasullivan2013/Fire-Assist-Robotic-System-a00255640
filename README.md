# Fire-Assist-Robotic-System

An Arduino system that detects temperature, light and distance. If values become unsafe user is alerted through LEDs.
Arduino system comes with an autonomous mode, where it will travel freely and avoid objects until temperature or light are within an unsafe range.

Application consists of three controller types: Physical Controller, Voice Controller, Gyroscope Controller.

Connection between arduino and application is bluetooth.

Instructions:

  1: Download the files.
  2: Using Arduino import FireAssistRobot and upload to arduino board.
  3: Install FireAssist Application on your Android Device.
  4: You're good to go!
